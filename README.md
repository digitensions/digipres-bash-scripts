# digipres-bash-scripts
This is a repository to stash some useful scripts I've part way through making or amendeding, that I hope to use in various digipres workflows. Some of them wont have had full testing yet (looking at tar_script.sh which is untested and just written out quickly for return to later).

They're written in bash shell and I hope to add Python 3 in later monhts. If you wish to experiment or test them please create a safe environment to do so.

Comments and feedback welcomed.

You can find out more about the use of these scripts at https://digitensions.home.blog where I've blogged about various open source and script developments for archival usage.
