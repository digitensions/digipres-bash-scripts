'''
Learning script that references a dictionary of films to see if user input film made it to the BFI's top 50 list.
Asks you to enter a film you'd like to check, then lists the item and it's rank if successful.
If not, asks if you'd like to see the complete list.
Asks finally if you'd like to restart the process by checking another title or not.
