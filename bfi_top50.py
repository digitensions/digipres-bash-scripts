'''
Fun script that references a dictionary of films and ranks, to see if you favourite film made it to the BFI's top 50 list.
Asks you to enter a film you'd like to check
Lists the item and it's rank if successful
If not, asks if you'd like to see the complete list
Asks finally if you'd like to restart the process by checking another title
